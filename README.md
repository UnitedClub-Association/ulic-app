ULIC - University Laboratory ICT Club

The official cross-platform application for the University Laboratory ICT Club.

🚀 About ULIC
ULIC, which stands for University Laboratory ICT Club, is the official technology and innovation club of the University Laboratory School and College (ULSC). We are a passionate community of students dedicated to exploring the vast world of Information and Communication Technology.

As one of the first eight clubs established at our institution, we have a foundational role in the school's extracurricular landscape. Founded in October 2024, we became a key member of the United Club Association (UCA) upon its inception in January 2025.

Our core mission is to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application. We take pride in our role as the digital backbone for our fellow clubs, managing and developing the official websites and applications for every club on campus, as well as for the UCA itself.
